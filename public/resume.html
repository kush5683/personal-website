          Warden - Intrusion Detection Built for Containerized Servers,
          Worcester, MA
        </h2>
        <p>
          As my senior capstone I worked with two other students to design and
          create Warden, a intrusion detection system that interfaces with PHP
          sites to enforce control flow integrity. The system was built on top
          of Professor Craig Shue’s existing Single Use Server Project but
          Warden can easily be adapted to any LAMP stack system.Warden has a
          layered approach to CFI that has not been seen before. More
          information can be found on
